# Week 7
## 3.4 Managing Software

This week I explored the `sudo` function. 

I started with the `sudo apt update` command. The results were 519 updates required.

I then ran the `sudo apt upgade` command to install the requested updates.
*Note to self, check updates every login*. I thought I was doing this, but I might have missed a
few weeks, or forgot to restart. **It takes forever to run 519 updates**.
