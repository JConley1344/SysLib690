# Week 13- Omeka

## Preinstallation Steps
I ran `sudo apt update` and needed to update 40 packages on my virtual machine. 
I then ran `sudo atp upgrade` to install all 40 packages. 
I then needed to step away from my machine, so I used `reboot now` to make sure all updates took.

When I came back to the virtual machine, all packages were up to date. 

I started with doing the prerequist command lines from the systems librarian book. I ran `sudo apt install imagemagick` then ran the line `sudo a2enmod rewrite`. I was then promted to `systemctl restart apache2`, so I ran the line `
sudo systemctl restart apache2` to restart apache2.  Everything was in place to start installation, downloading, and configuring of Omeka.
