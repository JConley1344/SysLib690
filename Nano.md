# What I Have Learned

I watched the weekly video introducing what I needed to do to explore text editors. 
**Learned** that a text editor is a program that reworks plain text, not rich text. 
**Think Notepad** verses *Microsoft Word**
*Personally started to feel a little out of my element, YouTube helps, a lot.*
Then realize I have learned a lot this semester, very proud of myself being outside my
comfort zone.

## Nano

1. Created a new directory named 'nano'.
2. Created new files in 'nano' directory - about 8 for pracctice.
3. Created a file titled .nanorc
4. Practiced typing different information into text editor.
5. Practied different keystoke from the bottom.
6. Read though the 'ctrl+g' help information.
7. Finally, added the command lines from class to file by hand to get practice typing.
8. Lastly, saved file using 'ctrl+o' to complete my exploration of nano.

### Extras Explored Week 5
I went ahead and conducted updates using the code 'sudo apt update'. 
Got very comfortable using CLI codes to navigate around. Then copied exact coding from the book 
to this post to make it look like

...
{list files and directories.................. ls
print name of current/working directory..... pwd
create a new directory...................... mkdir
remove or delete an empty directory......... rmdir
change directory............................ cd
create an empty file........................ touch
print characters to output.................. echo
display contents of a text file............. cat
copy a file or directory.................... cp
move or rename a file or directory.......... mv
remove or delete a file or directory........ rm}
...
