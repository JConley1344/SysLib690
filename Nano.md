# What I Have Learned

I watched the weekly video introducing what I needed to do to explore text editors. 
**Learned** that a text editor is a program that reworks plain text, not rich text. 
**Think Notepad** verses *Microsoft Word**
*Personally started to feel a little out of my element, YouTube helps, a lot.*
Then realize I have learned a lot this semester, very proud of myself being outside my
comfort zone.

## Nano

1. Created a new directory named 'nano'.
2. Created new files in 'nano' directory - about 8 for pracctice.
3. Created a file titled .nanorc
4. Practiced typing different information into text editor.
5. Practied different keystoke from the bottom.
6. Read though the 'ctrl+g' help information.
7. Finally, added the command lines from class to file by hand to get practice typing.

### Extras Explored Week 5
I went ahead and conducted updates using the code 'sudo apt update'. 
Got very comfortable using CLI codes to navigate around.
