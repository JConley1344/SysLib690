#Week 9 OPAC

After last week's chaotic start I was a bit skiddish to start this week. I am very extremely cauious after watching all my hard work go down in flames.

## HTML Page
In `cd /var/ww/html/ I created the file` **mylibrary.html**. I then added the code to create the basic seach box.

```
<html>
<head>
<title>MySQL Server Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>A Basic OPAC</h1>

<p>In the form below,
<b>optionally</b> enter text in the search field.
You can search by author, title, or publisher.
Capitalization is not necessary.
It's okay to enter partial information,
like part of an author's, title's, or publisher's name.</p>

<p>The date fields are <b>required</b>.
You can use the date fields to limit results.
I added some extra records,
which you can view to know what you can query:</p>

<p><a href="http://35.232.255.82/opac.php">http://35.232.255.82/opac.php</a></p>

<p>This is very much a toy,
stripped down
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_public_access_catalog">OPAC</a>.
The records are basic.
Not only do they not conform to
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a>,
but they don't even conform to something
as simple as
<a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.

<p>I also don't provide options
to select different fields,
like author, title, or publisher fields.
Instead the search field below searches
all the fields
(author, title, publisher)
in our <b>books</b> table.</p>

<p>The key idea is to get a sense
of how an OPAC works, though.</p>

<h2>My Basic Library OPAC</h2>
<form method="post" action="search.php">
    <label for="search">Search:</label>
    <input type="text" name="search" id="search">
    <br>
    <label for="start_date">Start Date:</label>
    <input type="date" name="start_date" id="start_date">
    <br>
    <label for="end_date">End Date:</label>
    <input type="date" name="end_date" id="end_date">
    <br>
    <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>


</body>
</html>
```

## PHP Search Form
I chose to stick with the `nano` editor instead of vim like the video, mostly because it is the only one I have really used. I did test out other editors
during section *3.2* but found I understand and like `nano`. I proceeded to use the code for provided for **search.php**. I chose to copy and paste, to avoid major issues in typing. 

```
<?php
// Load MySQL credentials
require_once 'login.php';

// Establish connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password) or
  die("Unable to connect");

// Open database
mysqli_select_db($conn, $db_database) or
  die("Could not open database '$db_database'");

// Check if search query was submitted
if (isset($_POST['search'])) {
    // Sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks
    $search = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['search']);

    // Get the start and end dates for the date range
    $start_date = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['start_date']);
    $end_date = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['end_date']);

    // Build the MySQL query with a WHERE
    // clause that includes the date range filter
    $query = "SELECT * FROM books WHERE
        (author LIKE '%$search%' OR
        title LIKE '%$search%' OR
        publisher LIKE '%$search%') AND
        copyright BETWEEN '$start_date' AND '$end_date'";

    // Execute the query
    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);

    // Check if any results were returned
    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
        // Loop through the results and output them
        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
            echo "ID: " . $row["id"] . "<br>";
            echo "Author: " . $row["author"] . "<br>";
            echo "Title: " . $row["title"] . "<br>";
            echo "Publisher: " . $row["publisher"] . "<br>";
            echo "Copyright: " . $row["copyright"] . "<br><br>";
        }
    } else {
        echo "No results found.";
    }

    // Free up memory by closing the MySQL result set
    mysqli_free_result($result);
}

// Close the MySQL connection
mysqli_close($conn);

echo "<p>Return to search page: <a href='http://35.232.255.82/mylibrary.html'>http://35.232.255.82/mylibrary.html</a></p>";

?>
```

I then connected to MySQL with `mysql -u opacuser -p`.

I then added the titles at the end. Got an error code and realized I forgot to set the database with `use opacdb:`. Once I got that set I then added 

```
insert into books
(author, title, publisher, copyright) values
('Emma Donoghue', 'Room', 'Little, Brown \& Company', '2010-08-06'),
('Zadie Smith', 'White Teeth', 'Hamish Hamilton', '2000-01-27');
```
I realized these were duplicates because I had added them last week. I then used code `delete from books where author='Emma Donoghue';` and `delete from books where author='Zadie Smith';`.

This removed both files completely from the database. I then used `insert into books
(author, title, publisher, copyright) values
('Emma Donoghue', 'Room', 'Little, Brown \& Company', '2010-08-06'),
('Zadie Smith', 'White Teeth', 'Hamish Hamilton', '2000-01-27');` and added the titles back to the database.

I then grabbed last nights books my son and I read from the shelf and added them.

![OIP](https://github.com/JConley1344/SysLib690/assets/157387139/63777266-f6dd-4304-9489-3e4f9c75fe30)

I had a few issues with syntax. I kept typing things wrong. I got frustrated and walked away from it. My husband suggested I use ***Notepad*** to type everyting in first then copy it to the server.
It **NEVER** crossed my mind that to help fix typing issues I could type it in notepad and transfer it. **LIFE CHANGING**

**I added 6 books** 
*Little Blue Truck* by Alice Schertle, *Daddy* by Leslie Patricelli, *Mommy* by Leslie Patricelli, *Hop Hop* by Leslie Patricelli, *All Kinds of Kindness* by Judy Carey Nevin, and *The Rabbit Listned* by Cori Doerrfeld.  
I did have issues adding more than 2 at a time. So I just went slow.

```
insert into books (author, title, publisher, copyright) values
('Leslie Patricelli', 'Mommy', 'Candlewick Press', '2021-03-02'),
('Leslie Patricelli', 'Daddy', 'Candlewick Press', '2021-03-02');
```
```
insert into books (author, title, publisher, copyright) values
('Leslie Patricelli', 'Hop Hop', 'Candlewick Press', '2021-03-02'),
('Cori Doerrfeld', 'The Rabbit Listened', 'Dial Books', '2020-06-30');
```
```
insert into books (author, title, publisher, copyright) values
(' Judy Carey Nevin', 'All Kinds of Kindness', 'Simon \& Schuster', '2020-06-30'),
('Alice Schertle', 'Little Blue Truck', 'HarperCollins', '2008-05-01');
```


*I now want to create a database of all 6 bookslves inside the house!* 

Especially the children's books. This way I could search it and see if I owned it when at the bookstore. Sometimes I can't remember. ðŸ˜†
