# Week 6-Grep Searching
## **Reproducing the Examples**

For this weeks work I started in the UK database Scopus. I first started by recreating what 
I saw in the video and found the articles and information. I then used that metadata to follow 
along with the weekly video to work through kystrokes and understanding. I felt comfortable enough
to try pulling different data and seeing if I could understand the results.

## **New Data**
*Searching using the term "social emotional learning"*
This search yelded **1506** results. I took the first two pages of results to download, which was *20*
total titles.

## Uploading the File
I opened the terminal. I connected to the terminal, and connected via gcloud command. I then created a file
named `scopus.bib`. I then started to explore the `grep` codes with this file. 
**I was able to open a SSH-in-browser window and just select **upload file** without issues, it opened undermy normal gcloud name.*

Using the `grep -Eio "^@(A|B)[A-Z]*" scopus.bib | sort | uniq -c` 
I was able to see that of the *20* files 19 were articles and 1 was a book.
     `19 @ARTICLE
      1 @BOOK`

I then wanted to look at citations because I noted everything I had pulled was published in 2024. I Found that interesteing. Using 
` grep -o "Cited by: [0-9]*" scopus.bib | \
    awk -F":" \
    'BEGIN { printf "Total Citations: "} \
    { sum += $2; } \
    END { print sum }'`
I was able to see that there was a total of 6 citations. Which is more than I thought they might have due to the dates. 

Also I sorted the journal titles out using
`grep "journal =" scopus.bib | cut -d"=" -f2 | \
    sed 's/ {//' | sed 's/},//' | \
    sort | uniq -c | sort`
and found that there were 20 different journal/book titles, not one that might have more infomraiton regularly on the topic. 

## Playing with More Data
I went ahead and searched in scopus "social emotional learning" from just 2023. It resultsed in 300 doucments. I uploaded the file title scopus1.bib to gcloud
and went off to explore. 

I first ran the code `grep -Eio "@(A|B)[A-Z]*" scopus1.bib | sort | uniq -c` to breakdown the sources of the documents. The results were 249 articles, 39 books, 
and a bunch of different sources. 
`   249 @ARTICLE
     39 @BOOK
      2 @achva
      1 @act
      1 @andrew
      1 @angelo
      2 @ankara
      1 @arizona
      1 @assumption
      1 @asu
      1 @barrcenter
      1 @branksome
      1 @brocku
      1 @brown
      2 @bsu
      1 @bu
      3 @buffalo
      1 @byu`

Then I decided to run the code
`grep -o "Cited by: [0-9]*" scopus1.bib | \
> awk -F":" \
> 'BEGIN {printf "Total Citations: "} \
> { sum += $2; } \
> END { print sum }'`
> and found that only 274 total citations had come from these articles. I wondered if this was common.
>
Lastly I ran the code *after a few typos*
`grep "journal =" scopus1.bib | cut -d"=" -f2 | sed s'/ {//' | sed 's/}, //' | \
> sort | uniq -c | sort`.
> I was able to put together a list of the journal titles.

### Review
I continue to struggle with flashcards. I just struggle with confience in the moment with this class. I am learning a lot and really taking the time throughout the week to practice with the intent of learning everything we do.
I feel very confident on learn-the-cli and learn-thefilesystem.
