# GitHub Learning

I will *work* hard to learn the correct **snytax** to work in GitHub.  Continuing to learn the correct keystroke functions.

This is all very new to me. I find that I have been **struggling** finding
the correct keys to make the coding work while I practice. 

I know that I need to work on:
1. Slowing down my keystrokes until I better understand what I am doing.
2. Learn whta main keys I will be using because ' and ` are very different keys.
3. For the love of god proofread your keystrokes, there have been some funny words.
*Spelling* is **Important**.

I do not know basic `codes` for programming. I feel at a bit of a **disatvantage**.
I believe that as this class goes on I will learn what I need to be proficient. 

One of my favorite Disney movie quotes is:
```
*Sometimes the right path is not the easiest one*.
```
This sticks out at to me a lot this semester, because I have second guessed my class choices. 
This will be one of the biggest learning semesters I have had. Everything I am taking it outside my wheelhouse.
I must continue to focus , **Challenge Accepted**.
